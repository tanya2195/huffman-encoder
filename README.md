Transferred an enormous amount of data by writing optimized algorithms on Huffman Coding. Compressed the data by
1/3rd​ ​ before transmitting it over the network.​ Implemented the data structure through 3 different priority queues​ : Binary
Heap, Pairing Heap, 4-way heap. Concluded that u​ sing 4-way optimized heap result​ ed​ in a reduced time complexity by
1/4th of that of Binary Heap​ .
